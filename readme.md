Neighborhood Map Project-- Finding food around you!

Note: This project uses Knockoutjs, Ajax, Bootstrap and Google Maps APIs. Also-- had some issues with initial KO & rendering and looked through various posts on the forum -- thanks!


1.) Getting Started
http://jess-fortino.github.io/neighborhood-map

After the page is loaded, user can click any of the markers in the Map to find more information about the selected location.

The application also includes a list of view, representing each of the markers in the map, which are clickable to display information as well.

A search/filter is included to filter out the locations, based on the name of the location.

2.) What you need
Internet connection
Browser
Location

3.) Enjoy!
Have fun finding food near you! I hope you're hungry!
